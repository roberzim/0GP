"""
This file is a replacement for the existing ``salva_tutto.py`` in the
0GP repository.  It introduces a dualâ€‘write mechanism that persists
practices both to the canonical JSON structure and to the new SQLite
database.  If the database transaction fails for any reason the JSON
write proceeds and the error is logged so that the UI can notify the
user.

The interface of the module remains compatible with the original
implementation: call :func:`salva_tutto(pratica_dict)` to persist a
practice.  The caller is responsible for handling any returned errors.
